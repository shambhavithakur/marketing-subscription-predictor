# Predicting whether or not a customer will purchase a marketing subscription

The goal of this project is to build a classification model. This model needs to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a product that a bank is marketing to&nbsp;them. The data for this project has been sourced from [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing).

This project is divided across four notebooks. In the first notebook, we will explore the project data and prepare the data for model building. In the next three notebooks, we will use the prepared data to build and validate classifiers.
