# Predicting whether or not a customer will purchase a marketing subscription

The goal of this project is to build a classification model. This model needs to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a product that a bank is marketing to&nbsp;them. The data for this project has been sourced from [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing).

This project is divided across three notebooks. In the first notebook, we will explore the project data, and in the second notebook, we will build a classifier using the data. In the third notebook, we will deploy the classifier.
